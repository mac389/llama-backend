   Jeffrey Friedman

   Dr. Friedman studies the molecular mechanisms that regulate food intake
   and body weight. Genetic studies in mice led to the identification of
   leptin, a hormone made by fat tissue that plays a key role in
   regulating weight. Current studies explore the mechanisms by which
   leptin controls feeding behavior and body weight. Studies to identify
   other key regulators are also under way.

   Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that energy balance in
   animals and humans is tightly controlled. With the identification of
   leptin and its receptors by the Friedman laboratory, two of the
   molecular components of a system that maintains constant weight have
   been identified. Leptin is a hormone secreted by the adipose (fat)
   tissue in proportion to its mass that in turn modulates food intake
   relative to energy expenditure. Increased fat mass increases leptin
   levels, which in turn reduces body weight; decreased fat mass leads to
   a decrease in leptin levels and an increase in body weight. By this
   mechanism, weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range.
   Defects in the leptin gene are associated with severe obesity in
   animals and in humans.

   Leptin acts on sets of neurons in brain centers that control energy
   balance to regulate appetite. Leptin also plays a general role in
   regulating many of the physiologic responses that are observed with
   changes in nutritional state, with clear effects on female
   reproduction, immune function and the function of many other hormones,
   including insulin.

   Current research in the Friedman lab focuses on a series of questions
   pertinent to the regulation of body weight: How does the fat cell
   regulate how much leptin is made -- i.e., how does the fat cell know
   how fat it is? How does a single molecule (leptin) change feeding, a
   complex behavior? How do brain pathways that are modulated by leptin in
   turn regulate peripheral metabolism and insulin action? Does variation
   in the genes that compose the physiologic circuit of which leptin is a
   component explain differences in body weight?

   The recent identification of the hypothalamic cells that express the
   leptin receptor is enabling Dr. Friedman and his colleagues to
   delineate the precise neuronal effects of leptin and the mechanisms by
   which this single molecule can alter a complex behavior. Recent studies
   have revealed that leptin reduces food intake by decreasing the
   pleasure associated with food. This finding suggests that the pleasure
   derived from eating is not fixed but rather reflects the status of
   metabolic signals.

   The lab has also identified a specific neural population in the
   hypothalamus that expresses a bioactive peptide known as MCH, which
   plays key role in sensing the reward value of food. Ongoing studies
   seek to understand how leptin modulates the activity of these neurons.
   In addition, several new methods have also been developed for
   identifying additional neural populations that regulate feeding. In the
   first, a novel gene profiling technology can be used to define neural
   populations whose activities are regulated by a stimulus. In the
   second, gene profiling technology is used to define specific neural
   populations based on their anatomic connections. Finally, the lab has
   developed a new method for probing neural function using magnets or
   radiowaves to remotely modulate the activity of specific neural
   populations in vivo.

   The Friedman lab is also studying the molecular mechanisms responsible
   for changes of leptin gene expression associated with changes in fat
   mass. The amount of leptin that is expressed from fat is strongly
   regulated, with a more than 100-fold increase in expression from ob/ob
   adipose tissue compared to adipose tissue of a lean or fasted animal,
   suggesting that fat cells know how much fat they have and adjust leptin
   expression accordingly. To identify the underlying mechanism
   responsible for this regulation, Dr. Friedman and his colleagues are
   using transgenic mice to identify DNA regulatory elements that change
   expression of a reporter gene controlled by the leptin gene
   proportionately with changes in adipose tissue mass. They have thus
   modified a series of leptin bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
   clones so that the leptin DNA regulatory elements direct the expression
   of luciferase. This has enabled the researchers to identify DNA
   regulatory sequences that control leptin gene expression as well as
   protein factors binding to these sequences. Studies to elucidate how
   the activity of these factors changes, as fat is gained or lost, are
   underway. Dr. Friedman hypothesizes that these studies will lead to the
   identification of a novel lipid sensing signaling pathway in adipocytes
   and possibly other cell types.

   Leptin has potent metabolic effects to improve insulin action and
   reduce the lipid content of peripheral tissues as retained and is now
   an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of severe lipodystrophy, a form
   of diabetes. The Friedman lab is studying the mechanism responsible for
   leptin's antidiabetic function in this and other forms of diabetes.
   Current data suggests that leptin interferes with both the production
   and the action of glucagon, a hormone that acts to increase blood
   glucose by opposing the effects of insulin. The cellular mechanisms
   responsible for this are under investigation.

   In collaboration with Tayfun Ozcelik at Bilkent University in Ankara,
   Turkey, the Friedman lab is conducting studies of consanguineous
   marriages that include patients who are either morbidly obese,
   extremely lean or have polycystic ovary disease (PCOS), which is
   associated with extreme resistance to insulin. Whole genome sequencing
   is now underway on more than 50 families, with the expectation that
   analyses of the DNA sequences from patients who are lean and obese will
   reveal DNA mutations that contribute to differences in weight, or, in
   other families, that lead to PCOS.

CAREER

   Dr. Friedman graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and, in
   1977 at the age of 22, received his M.D. from Albany Medical College of
   Union University. After completing two residencies at Albany Medical
   Center Hospital, Dr. Friedman came to Rockefeller as a postgraduate
   fellow and associate physician in 1980. In 1986 he received his Ph.D.,
   working in the lab of James E. Darnell Jr., and was appointed assistant
   professor. He was named head of laboratory in 1991, professor and in
   1995 and Marilyn M. Simpson Professor in 1999. He has been an
   investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1986.

   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and its Institute of
   Medicine, his honors include the King Faisal International Prize in
   Medicine, the BBVA Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Biomedicine, the
   Fondation IPSEN Endocrine Regulation Prize, the Albert Lasker Award for
   Basic Medical Research, the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine,
   the Keio Medical Science Prize, the Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal,
   the Danone International Prize for Nutrition, the Gairdner Foundation
   International Award and the Passano Foundation Award.

   Dr. Friedman is a faculty member in the David Rockefeller Graduate
   Program and the Tri-Institutional M.D.-Ph.D. Program.
