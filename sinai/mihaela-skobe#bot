   The main research interest of my laboratory is in understanding the
   mechanisms of cancer metastasis via the lymphatic system and the
   function of lymphatic vessels in the regulation of immune response.

   Metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death for cancer
   patients. The first site to which cancer cells metastasize are lymph
   nodes, and the extent of lymph node involvement is a major criterion
   for evaluating patient prognosis and the choice of therapy. Despite the
   fact that the importance of the lymphatic system as a pathway for
   cancer metastasis has been well recognized, research efforts over the
   past decades have been focused primarily on understanding the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the blood vasculature. Thus, the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the lymphatic system remain poorly
   understood. Aside from serving as a transport system for tumor cells,
   the lymphatic system normally collects extravasated fluid,
   macromolecules and leukocytes from tissues and returns them to the
   blood circulation. By directing antigen-presenting cells, T-cells and
   antigens from peripheral tissues into the lymph nodes, lymphatic
   vessels play an important role in the initiation of immune response.
   However, the mechanisms by which leukocytes are mobilized into the
   lymphatic vessels are poorly understood, and in particular, the role of
   lymphatic vessels in the process remains unknown.

   Our long-term research efforts are dedicated towards elucidating the
   molecular mechanisms which regulate lymphatic vessel growth (i.e.
   lymphangiogenesis) and the function of lymphatic vessels in cancer and
   in normal physiology. Current research includes investigations of the
   mechanisms by which tumor cells interact with the lymphatic vasculature
   during early steps of metastasis. We are investigating the role of role
   of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules expressed by the lymphatic
   endothelium in tumor invasion and metastasis, to gain insight into the
   mechanisms which regulate tumor cell migration and entry into the
   lymphatic vessels. We are also investigating the molecular mechanisms
   of lymphangiogenesis. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the
   induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis by the Vascular Endothelial Growth
   Factor-C (VEGF-C) facilitates tumor metastases. The goals of our
   current research activities are to better understand the mechanisms by
   which VEGF-C promotes metastasis and to assess the potential of VEGF-C
   and its receptors as targets for the anti-metastatic therapy. Our
   efforts are also dedicated towards identification of novel
   lymphangiogenic factors and markers of the lymphatic endothelium.
   Finally, the lab is exploring the role of lymphatic vasculature in the
   regulation of immune response, particularly its function in regulating
   migration and activation of antigen-presenting cells. The ultimate goal
   of these studies is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by
   which lymphatic endothelial cells control physiological cell migration
   and to examine whether tumor cells take advantage of these mechanisms
   to gain access to the lymphatic vessels. The knowledge gained with the
   above studies may provide a foundation for the development of new
   therapeutic approaches to predict, arrest and treat cancer metastases.
